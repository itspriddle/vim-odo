# odo.vim

Odo is a GUI window manager for MacVim, named after the shapeshifting security
chief from [Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odo_(Star_Trek).

`odo.vim` allows you to resize and reposition MacVim's GUI window without the
need to use your mouse.

## Usage

Odo provides the following mappings out of the box:

**Resizing the GUI window**

* Increase width:  `<C-M-l>`
* Decrease width:  `<C-M-h>`
* Increase height: `<C-M-k>`
* Decrease height: `<C-M-j>`

**Moving the GUI window**

* Move right: `<M-l>`
* Move left:  `<M-h>`
* Move down:  `<M-j>`
* Move up:    `<M-k>`

Odo also provides commands to move and resize the GUI window, `:Guiresize` and
`:Guinudge`.
